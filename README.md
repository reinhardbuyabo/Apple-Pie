# Apple Pie

## Overview
Apple Pie is a simple word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. Each incorrect guess results in a part of an apple pie being "eaten away" until the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.

This project is part of the *Develop in Swift Fundamentals* curriculum and serves as an introduction to UIKit, basic user interactions, and game logic implementation in Swift.

## Features
- Letter-based word-guessing gameplay
- Visual representation of incorrect guesses
- Interactive user interface using buttons and labels
- Simple game logic to track correct and incorrect guesses

## Technologies Used
- Swift
- UIKit
- Auto Layout
- Storyboards

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the app on a simulator or a physical iOS device.

## How to Play
1. Start the game and view the hidden word represented by underscores.
2. Tap letters to guess the word.
3. Each incorrect guess removes part of the apple pie.
4. Win by guessing all letters correctly before the pie is gone!

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the basics of UIKit and user interaction
- Work with labels, buttons, and images in iOS development
- Implement game logic using Swift programming concepts
